## ssr-ps.hlsl
An HLSL pixel shader that performs screen-space ray tracing to produce reflections on smooth surfaces. The shader was originally written for the Turbo Engine, and by extension makes use of a few include files for common functions and constants. The comments at the top of the file explain what symbols are included.
