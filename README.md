# Code Samples
Samples of code I have written

## ssr-ps.hlsl
An HLSL pixel shader that performs screen-space ray tracing to produce reflections on smooth surfaces. The shader was originally written for the Turbo Engine, and by extension makes use of a few include files for common functions and constants. The comments at the top of the file explain what symbols are included.

## metaprogramming-sample.hpp
A single function extracted from an Entity-Component-System framework I developed for Turbo Engine. The function is heavily commented to break down how it functions. The rest of the framework is just as (if not more) dense with template metaprogramming as this function. See [this repo](https://github.com/Curret/ECS) for the full code.
